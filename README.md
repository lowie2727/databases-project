## analyse code with PMD

edit the build.gradle file in the pmd section to the correct file location (and uncomment line)

if you want your build to fail, set ignoreFailures to false

```groovy
pmd {
    toolVersion = "6.52.0"
    //ruleSetFiles("path:\\to\\project\\top\\directory\\databases-project\\src\\main\\resources\\pmd\\pmdRules.xml")
    ignoreFailures = true
}
```

to test the program, execute the gradlew build command (generates html file)
